# ðŸš€ Deploy Monkey Snowfight to Railway (Free Online Multiplayer)

## âœ… Your Project is Ready for Deployment!

I've made the necessary changes:
- âœ… Server now serves game files
- âœ… Auto-detects WebSocket URL (works locally and online)
- âœ… Created package.json for deployment
- âœ… Added Express.js for serving static files

## Quick Deployment (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies Locally (Test First)
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
Visit `http://localhost:8080` - your game should work!

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository & Deploy
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository (e.g., "monkey-snowfight")
3. Upload your entire game folder to GitHub (drag & drop works!)
4. Go to https://railway.app/
5. Click "Start a New Project"
6. Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
7. Select your monkey-snowfight repository
8. Railway automatically detects it's a Node.js project and deploys!

**That's it! No additional configuration needed.**

### Step 3: Get Your URL
Railway will give you a URL like:
`https://monkey-snowfight-production.railway.app`

### Step 4: Share and Play!
- Send the URL to your brother
- Both visit the same URL
- Click "Find Players" and challenge each other!

**No downloads, no setup, no ngrok! Just visit the URL and play!**
